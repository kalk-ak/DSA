## 🚀 Welcome!

This repository documents my work and learning progression through **CSCI 1933: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms** at the University of Minnesota.

It serves as a personal archive of the many projects, labs, and exercises I completed. More than just a collection of files, this repo tells the story of my journey in learning how to build and analyze the fundamental building blocks of modern software.



## 🎓 About the Course

CSCI 1933 is a foundational computer science course focused on Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and the core structures used to implement them. The curriculum provided a deep dive into:

* **Linear Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
* **Non-Linear Structures:** Trees, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and Hash Tables
* **Algorithmic Analysis:** Understanding Big O notation ($O(n)$) and analyzing the time and space efficiency of algorithms.
* **Core Concepts:** Recursion, generics, and object-oriented design principles.
* **Sorting & Searching:** Implementing and analyzing various sorting algorithms.

## 📁 What's Inside This Repository?

This repository is structured by the projects and labs from the course. Each directory contains the source code for a specific assignment, demonstrating the practical implementation of a new data structure or algorithm.

> **Note:** This repository is a historical record of my learning process. The code reflects my understanding of the concepts at the time it was written.
