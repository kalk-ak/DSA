You can compile this project in any IDE or the terminal.
If you're in an IDE, hit the run button to get started.
For terminal lovers, just run the java file the usual way.
Once the program starts to run follow the instructions provided.

When the program's up, you'll be given shape options to draw.
There are 3 options for you.
Just type in the name of the shape you want, but make sure it's all in lower case.

Heads up on the triangle area – they're assumed to be isosceles.
which means two sides are the same length and aren't equal with the height.
