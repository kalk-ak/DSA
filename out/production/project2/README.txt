You can compile this project in any IDE or the terminal.
If you're in an IDE, hit the run button to get started.
For terminal lovers, just run the java file the usual way.
Once the program starts to run follow the instructions provided.

When the program's up, you'll be given the option to move a piece as a white piece. Then after
a valid move the move would alternate to black and then white again until someone eventually wins.

I've tried to make the program as robust as possible but the board dissplayed might look a bit
effiy but other than that I don't think it would run into an exception.
